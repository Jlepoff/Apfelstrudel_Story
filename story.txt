I had a weird Luftschloss about bratwurst and this is how it went.
This morning when I woke up, I had an irresistible urge to eat some bratwurst. 
But I did not want to eat alone, so I called Schneewittchen to come and enjoy it with me.
I got into my BMW and headed out on an adventure to pick up Schneewittchen and find some of the best bratwurst!
And of course, all of this was enjoyed at the local biergarten.
We fought over who could eat it the fastest we became wettbewerb-sfaehig.
I was then struck with a schnapsidee: hide the bratwurst in my lederhose!
Schneewittchen was fast to notice, "Kopfkino!"
