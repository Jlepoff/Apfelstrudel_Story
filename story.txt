This morning when I woke up, I had an irresistible urge to eat some bratwurst. 
But I did not want to eat alone, so I called Schneewittchen to come and enjoy it with me.
We fought over who could eat it the fastest we became wettbewerb-sfaehig.
I got into my BMW and headed out on an adventure to pick up Schneewittchen and find some of the best bratwurst!
